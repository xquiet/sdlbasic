<span class="text"><br>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="text">

sdlBasic syntax follows the Amos/darkBasic philosophy. There are some
data banks (slots), called by number, where&nbsp;sounds and images</span><span class="text"> are stored</span><span class="text">. </span><span class="text">Multimedia
files are loaded from disk to slots by a specific set of commands,
sdlBasic can handle different file formats for images, sound and music.
Can be loaded and stored up to&nbsp;32768 </span><span class="text">images and</span><span class="text"> up to 1024 sounds files. Naturally is possible to change
parameters values by writing on sources but, for ordinary use, current
values should be quite enough.<br>

<br>

Specific commands allow you to play sounds stored in sound slots using
computer sound card. Sounds can be&nbsp;played through different sound
channels so several sounds may be played at the same time. You can
dynamically change the</span><span class="text"> maximum</span><span class="text"> number of channels managed by sdlBasic for playing sounds.<br>

</span><span class="text"></span><span class="text"></span><br>

<span class="text">sdlBasic offer two set of instructions for
displaying images, that are stored in image slots, on computer monitor: they are called Sprites and
Bobs. You can use up to&nbsp;1024 sprites and 1024
bobs simultaneously on display. Bob and Sprites can be moved around without destroying
any existing graphics on background, so they are perfect for the moving
objects required by video games. Sprites and Bobs are </span><span class="text">"refreshed"
(re-painted on computer monitor) each time a "screen swap" is
performed. By apposite commands is possible to check collisions </span><span class="text">between&nbsp;sprites or</span><span class="text"> </span><span class="text">between a bobs. </span><br>

<span class="text">

Sprites are completely independent from screens. If needed, they can be clipped by specific
command within desired coordinates.</span><br>

<span class="text">

Bobs are very similar to sprites but, unlike them, they are relative </span><span class="text">to
screens, that means that bob can't exist outside screen surface and
that the bobs coordinate system is relative to its screen, so, if
screen scrolls screen's bobs follow. You
can decide on what screen a particular bob must operate.&nbsp;Bobs are
perfect in program using large scrolling screens. <br>
</span><br>

<span class="text">

</span><br>

<span class="text">

Display is where the graphical output is shown on computer monitor, it could be a window or
the full screen. By default sdlBasic open a&nbsp;windows (</span><span class="text">640 x 480 pixels) </span><span class="text">with
the&nbsp;desktop color depth. With the command
setDisplay() you can change display parameters.
Graphical output doesn't happen directly on display but it is executed
into some virtual screens.&nbsp;</span><span class="text">sdlBasic allow 8
(0-7) virtual screens. A virtual screen is&nbsp;a sort of digital canvas where all graphic operations </span><span class="text">are
executed </span><span class="text">. Screen 0 is opened by default&nbsp;with
the display
dimensions</span><span class="text">, that way it
cover all the display surface. Naturally it's possible to change this
parameters and to open and to close more screens. </span><span class="text">In
video games</span><span class="text"> it's common pratice to have a big screen for the game area and a smaller one for
scores, lives etc.</span><br>

<span class="text"></span></div>

<span class="text">
<br>



</span><span class="smallTitle">Example: </span><span class="text"><br>



</span>
<div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);"><span class="code">screenOpen(0,640,400,0,0,640,400,0)</span><br class="code">



<span class="code">screenOpen(1,640,80,0,400,640,80,0)</span><span class="text"></span><br>



<span class="text"></span></div>



<span class="text"><br>

</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="text">
This way screen 0 will have the size of 640x400
pixels and it will be in the upper side of display, at the same time
screen 1, that will be 640x80 pixels, will be shown in the lower side
of display, under screen 0.</span><br>

<span class="text">

It's possible to open screens bigger than it's visible size by writing:</span><br>

<span class="text"></span></div>

<span class="text">
<br>
</span><span class="smallTitle">Example: </span><br>

<div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);"><span class="code">screenOpen(0,6400,400,0,0,640,400,0)</span><span class="text"></span><br>



<span class="text"></span></div>



<span class="text"><br>

</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="text">The above example open&nbsp;a&nbsp; viewport on display of&nbsp;</span><span class="text">640x400 pixels</span><span class="text"> but the screen is ten times wider and it contine outside the visible portion.</span><br>

<span class="text">

We can make it scroll by writing following command:&nbsp; </span><br>

<span class="text"></span></div>

<span class="text">
<br>


</span><span class="smallTitle">Example: </span><br>



<div style="text-align: left; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 204);"><span class="code">offset(640,0)</span><br class="code">



<span class="code">so the screen will move at the x coordinate 640. Therefore, with the following routine</span><br class="code">



<span class="code">&nbsp;for i= 0 to 6400-640</span><br class="code">



<span class="code">&nbsp;&nbsp; offset(i,0)</span><br class="code">



<span class="code">&nbsp;&nbsp; screenSwap</span><br class="code">



<span class="code">&nbsp;next</span><span class="text"></span><br>



<span class="text"></span></div>



<span class="text"><br>

</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><span class="text">This way we&nbsp;have a simple and efficient scrolling routine.</span><br>

<span class="text">

To switch from a screen to another, we will use the command screen(n), where n is the screen number&nbsp; </span><br>

<span class="text">

All graphical commands operate on the current screen, that, if not specified, is last opened.</span><br>

<span class="text">

If, for performance reasons, you want to remove support to screens, you
can use command directScreen(). Naturally this choice may bring some
unwanted side effects but it will speed up programs considerably,
especially on older and slower PC.</span></div>
